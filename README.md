Overview
Cloud Client Libraries are the recommended method for calling Google Cloud APIs from your applications. Cloud Client Libraries use the natural conventions and style of the programming language that you're using for your application. Cloud Client Libraries handle low-level communication with the server, including authentication and retry logic.

Firestore is a fast, fully managed, serverless, NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling, high performance, and ease of application development.

Google APIs use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization.

Secret Manager lets you store API keys, passwords, certificates, and other sensitive data as binary blobs or text strings.

The Cloud Translation API enables your websites and applications to dynamically translate text programmatically. Cloud Translation can translate text for more than 100 languages, and it can detect the language of source text.

In this lab, you update a Python application that manages a list of books. You add the ability to log in to the application by using OAuth, and require the user to log in when adding, editing, or deleting books.

You also use the Cloud Translation API to translate the book descriptions into a different language. You add a user profile that stores the preferred language for the user.

What you will learn
In this lab, you learn to:

Create a simple Python Flask web application.
Use Secret Manager to store sensitive application data.
Use OAuth 2.0 to add user login to an application.
Use the Cloud Translation API to detect the language of text and translate text.
Setup and requirements
Before you click the Start Lab button
Note: Read these instructions.
Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click Start Lab, shows how long Google Cloud resources will be made available to you.
This Qwiklabs hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

What you need
To complete this lab, you need:

Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
Time to complete the lab.
Note: If you already have your own personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use it for this lab.
Note: If you are using a Pixelbook, open an Incognito window to run this lab.
How to start your lab and sign in to the Console
Click the Start Lab button. If you need to pay for the lab, a pop-up opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is a panel populated with the temporary credentials that you must use for this lab.

Credentials panel

Copy the username, and then click Open Google Console. The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Choose an account page.

Note: Open the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.
On the Choose an account page, click Use Another Account. The Sign in page opens.

Choose an account dialog box with Use Another Account option highlighted 

Paste the username that you copied from the Connection Details panel. Then copy and paste the password.

Note: You must use the credentials from the Connection Details panel. Do not use your Google Cloud Skills Boost credentials. If you have your own Google Cloud account, do not use it for this lab (avoids incurring charges).
Click through the subsequent pages:
Accept the terms and conditions.
Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
Do not sign up for free trials.
After a few moments, the Cloud console opens in this tab.

Note: You can view the menu with a list of Google Cloud Products and Services by clicking the Navigation menu at the top-left. Cloud Console Menu
Activate Google Cloud Shell
Google Cloud Shell is a virtual machine that is loaded with development tools. It offers a persistent 5GB home directory and runs on the Google Cloud.

Google Cloud Shell provides command-line access to your Google Cloud resources.

In Cloud console, on the top right toolbar, click the Open Cloud Shell button.

Highlighted Cloud Shell icon

Click Continue.

It takes a few moments to provision and connect to the environment. When you are connected, you are already authenticated, and the project is set to your PROJECT_ID. For example:

Project ID highlighted in the Cloud Shell Terminal

gcloud is the command-line tool for Google Cloud. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell and supports tab-completion.

You can list the active account name with this command:
gcloud auth list
Copied!
Output:

Credentialed accounts:
 - <myaccount>@<mydomain>.com (active)
</mydomain></myaccount>
Example output:

Credentialed accounts:
 - google1623327_student@qwiklabs.net
You can list the project ID with this command:
gcloud config list project
Copied!
Output:

[core]
project = <project_id>
</project_id>
Example output:

[core]
project = qwiklabs-gcp-44776a13dea667a6
Note: Full documentation of gcloud is available in the gcloud CLI overview guide .
Task 1. Set up the Python application and necessary resources
In this task, you download the Python application and create the resources used by the current version of the app.

Note: For most languages, indentation is used to make code more readable. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code, so indentation must be correct. The number of spaces used for indentation must be consistent. Mixing space and tabs for indentation can also cause issues. This lab uses four spaces for Python indentation.
Create the Firestore database
To create the Firestore database, in Cloud Shell, run the following command:

gcloud firestore databases create --location=region
Copied!
The Firestore database is used to store book and user profile data.

If you're asked to authorize Cloud Shell, click Authorize.

Create the Cloud Storage bucket with the correct permissions
To create the Cloud Storage bucket, run the following command:

gcloud storage buckets create gs://project_id-covers --location=region --no-public-access-prevention --uniform-bucket-level-access
Copied!
The Cloud Storage bucket is used to store book cover images. The bucket has uniform bucket level access and does not use public access prevention.

Note: If the command fails and the error indicates that the account does not have any valid credentials, try the command again. The permissions for the Qwiklabs student account might not have propagated yet.
To make all objects in the bucket publicly readable, run the following command:

gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs://project_id-covers --member=allUsers --role=roles/storage.legacyObjectReader
Copied!
To verify the objective, click Check my progress.
Set up the Python application and necessary resources

Copy the Python code to Cloud Shell
To copy the Python code from a Cloud Storage bucket into the home directory, run the following command:

gcloud storage cp gs://cloud-training/devapps-foundations/code/lab2/bookshelf.zip ~ && unzip ~/bookshelf.zip -d ~ && rm ~/bookshelf.zip
Copied!
To check the contents of the bookshelf directory, run the following command:

cd ~
ls -R bookshelf
Copied!
You should see a list that contains three Python files, a requirements file, and four template files:

bookshelf:
booksdb.py  main.py  requirements.txt  storage.py  templates

bookshelf/templates:
base.html  form.html  list.html  view.html
Install the required dependencies
To list the dependencies in the requirements file, run the following command:

cat ~/bookshelf/requirements.txt
Copied!
The requirements file specifies the following dependencies:

Flask: a web framework module used to design Python web applications
Gunicorn: a Python HTTP server that runs on Linux
Cloud Logging: used to log information from the application
Firestore: a fast, fully managed, serverless, NoSQL document database built for ease of application development
Cloud Storage: Google Cloud's unified object storage
To install the dependencies in the requirements file, run the following command:

pip3 install -r ~/bookshelf/requirements.txt --user
Copied!
pip is the package installer for Python. This pip3 command installs the packages specified in the requirements.txt file for use with Python version 3.

Test the application
To start the application, run the following command:

cd ~/bookshelf; ~/.local/bin/gunicorn -b :8080 main:app
Copied!
If you have successfully created the files, the application should now be hosted on port 8080.

To run the application in the web browser, click Web Preview, and then select Preview on port 8080.

Web Preview on port 8080

A new tab is opened in the browser, and the application is running. This page displays a list of all existing books. There are no books yet.

Note: If asked to authorize Cloud Shell, click Authorize.
Right-click this Wizard of Oz book cover image, and save it to your computer as oz.png:

Wizard of Oz book cover

In the application tab, click +Add book.

Enter the following information into the form:

Field	Value
Title	Wonderful Wizard of Oz
Author	Frank L. Baum
Date Published	1900
Description	A young girl and her dog are carried away to a magical land, where they meet a bunch of unusual people and learn not to stand under houses.
For Cover Image, click Choose File.

Select the file that you downloaded (oz.png), and click Open.

Click Save.

You're returned to the view page, and your book details are shown.

At the top of the page, click Books.

You're returned to the list page, and Wonderful Wizard of Oz is shown in the list, along with its book cover. The book details are stored in the Firestore database, and the cover image is stored in Cloud Storage.

Note: You can add other books, but do not modify Oz. It will be used for the rest of this lab.
In Cloud Shell, to quit the application, enter CTRL-C.

To verify the objective, click Check my progress.
Test the application and create a book

Task 2. Create OAuth authorization credentials for your application
In this task, you create authorization credentials that identify your application to Google's OAuth 2.0 server.

Create the OAuth consent screen
When you use OAuth 2.0 for authorization, your app requests one or more scopes of access from a Google Account. Google displays a consent screen to the user to capture the user's consent to share data with the application.

In the Google Cloud console, select the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), and then select APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen.

This page lets you select the type of users that will use your application. Internal users are users within your organization. External users are any users with a Google Account.

Click Get Started.

For App name, enter Bookshelf.

For User support email, select the student email.

Click Next.

For Audience, select External, and then click Next.

Users with a test account will be able to log in to the app.

On the left panel of the lab instructions, copy the Username.

Copy username

For Email addresses, paste the copied username, and then click Next.

Enable the checkbox to agree to the user data policy, and then click Continue.

Click Create.

In the navigation menu, click Branding.

Click + Add Domain.

In the Authorized domains section, for Authorized domain 1, enter cloudshell.dev.

When the application is running in Cloud Shell, cloudshell.dev is the domain name.

Click Save.

In the navigation menu, click Data Access.

Next, you need to select scopes that will be requested of users for your application. Scopes express the types of private user data in the user's Google Account that the application would like to access.

There are three types of scopes:

Sensitive scopes require verification by Google before they can be presented to the user in a consent screen.
Restricted scopes include even more sensitive information, from apps like Gmail and Drive, and can require a more extensive review.
Non-sensitive scopes are scopes that are less sensitive, and they do not require verification by Google.
Click Add or Remove Scopes.

A list of scopes is presented.

At the beginning of the list, select the box next to openid.

For Filter, enter userinfo.profile, press Enter, and then select the box next to the .../auth/userinfo.profile scope.

For Filter, clear the userinfo.profile filter, enter contacts, press Enter, and then select the box for the .../auth/contacts scope.

Click Update.

You should see two non-sensitive scopes (openid and userinfo.profile), and one sensitive scope (contacts).

Note: This lab will not use the contacts scope, but it's just used as an example. Your applications should use the minimum scopes required for the application.
Click Save.

In the navigation menu, click Audience.

Test users are required when users are external and publishing status is set to Testing.

Click + Add Users.

On the left panel of the lab instructions, copy the Username again.

In the Add users pane, paste the copied username into the box, and then click Save.

Create the OAuth 2.0 credentials
In the navigation menu, click Clients, and then click + Create Client.

For Application type, select Web application.

For Name, enter Bookshelf.

For Authorized redirect URIs, click + Add URI.

The URI specified here will be used when Google redirects the browser back to the application after capturing user consent.

To get the redirect URI, in Cloud Shell, run the following command:

echo "https://8080-${WEB_HOST}/oauth2callback"
Copied!
Copy the URI that was created by the echo command, and then, for URIs 1, paste in the URI.

Click Create.

Click Download JSON, and then save the client secret JSON to your local machine.

The client secret file will be used to verify your app with Google.

Click Close.

In Cloud Shell, click More (More icon) in the top-right toolbar, and then click Upload.

Click Choose Files, and select the client secret JSON file, and then click Open.

Click Upload.

The client secret JSON file is now available in the home directory. The contents of this file will be used during the OAuth process.

In Cloud Shell, run the following command:

cat ~/client_secret_*.json
Copied!
The JSON contents include the client_secret, which should be treated like a password. For example, you never want to store this JSON file into a code repository.

Store client secret JSON in Secret Manager
Secret Manager is a secure and recommended place to store the client secret JSON file.

To enable the Secret Manager API, run the following command:

gcloud services enable secretmanager.googleapis.com
Copied!
To rename the client secret file, run the following command:

mv ~/client_secret*.json ~/client_secret.json
Copied!
To create the secret, run the following command:

gcloud secrets create bookshelf-client-secrets --data-file=$HOME/client_secret.json
Copied!
There is now a secret named bookshelf-client-secrets that can be accessed from your application.

Another secret value that is needed for your application is the Flask secret key, which is used to sign information in cookies.

To create a secret for the Flask secret key, run the following command:

tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 </dev/urandom | head -c 20 | gcloud secrets create flask-secret-key --data-file=-
Copied!
This command creates a random 20 character alphanumeric password, and then stores it in a secret named flask-secret-key.

To verify the objective, click Check my progress.
Create OAuth authorization credentials for your application

Task 3. Use Secret Manager for retrieving secrets in the application
In this task, you modify the application to use Secret Manager.

Modify the requirements file to add Secret Manager
Open the file called requirements.txt with nano using the following command:

nano ~/bookshelf/requirements.txt
Copied!
In the requirements file, use the down arrow to move to the first empty line, and then add the following line:

google-cloud-secret-manager==2.24.0
Copied!
The requirements.txt file should now look like this:

Flask==3.1.1
gunicorn==23.0.0
google-cloud-logging==3.12.1
google-cloud-firestore==2.21.0
google-cloud-storage==2.17.0
google-cloud-secret-manager==2.24.0
To save the file and exit, click CTRL-X, click Y, and then click Enter.

To install the updated versions of the dependencies, run the following command:

pip3 install -r ~/bookshelf/requirements.txt --user
Copied!
Create a function to retrieve secrets
The secrets.py file contains code to retrieve secrets from Secret Manager.

To create the secrets.py file, run the following command:

cat > ~/bookshelf/secrets.py <<EOF
import os
from google.cloud import secretmanager

def get_secret(secret_id, version_id='latest'):

    # create the secret manager client
    client = secretmanager.SecretManagerServiceClient()

    # build the resource name of the secret version
    project_id = os.getenv('GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT')
    name = f"projects/{project_id}/secrets/{secret_id}/versions/{version_id}"

    # access the secret version
    response = client.access_secret_version(name=name)

    # return the decoded secret
    return response.payload.data.decode('UTF-8')

EOF
Copied!
The get_secret() function accepts a secret ID and an optional version ID. The requested secret is returned from the function.

Modify main.py to use Secret Manager
The main code file should call Secret Manager to retrieve secrets.

In a file editor, open the file ~/bookshelf/main.py.

After the import for storage, add the following line:

import secrets
Copied!
This line imports the secrets.py file you just created.

In the app.config.update function call, change the SECRET_KEY from:

    SECRET_KEY='secret', # don't store SECRET_KEY in code in a production app
to:

    SECRET_KEY=secrets.get_secret('flask-secret-key'),
Copied!
The Flask secret key is no longer stored in the application code.

Save the file.

Task 4. Create functions for OAuth flow
In this task, you add functions that manage the OAuth login flow.

When a user logs in to the web application, the app will start the OAuth authorization sequence. OAuth allows the user to authenticate and consent to access being requested by the application. The OAuth authorization sequence looks like this:

OAuth authorization sequence

The authorization sequence begins when the application redirects the browser to a Google URL. Google handles the user authentication, session selection, and user consent. The result is an authorization code, which the application can exchange for an access token and a refresh token.

The application stores the refresh token for future use, and uses the access token to access Google APIs. The Bookshelf application calls a Google API to retrieve information about the user. When the access token expires, the application uses the refresh token to obtain a new access token.

Add dependencies
The Python OAuth client for Google requires three more Python packages.

In the ~/bookshelf/requirements.txt file, add the following lines:

google-api-python-client==2.178.0
google-auth==2.40.3
google-auth-oauthlib==1.2.2
Copied!
The requirements.txt file should now look like this:

Flask==3.1.1
gunicorn==23.0.0
google-cloud-logging==3.12.1
google-cloud-firestore==2.21.0
google-cloud-storage==2.17.0
google-cloud-secret-manager==2.24.0
google-api-python-client==2.178.0
google-auth==2.40.3
google-auth-oauthlib==1.2.2
Save the file.

To install the updated versions of the dependencies, run the following command:

pip3 install -r ~/bookshelf/requirements.txt --user
Copied!
Add OAuth functions to manage the authorization flow
The oauth.py file contains code to retrieve an OAuth token from Google.

To create the oauth.py file, run the following command:

cat > ~/bookshelf/oauth.py <<EOF
import google.oauth2.credentials
import google_auth_oauthlib.flow
from uuid import uuid4
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from werkzeug.exceptions import Unauthorized

def _credentials_to_dict(credentials):
    """
    Convert credentials mapping (object) into a dictionary.
    """
    return {
        'token': credentials.token,
        'refresh_token': credentials.refresh_token,
        'token_uri': credentials.token_uri,
        'client_id': credentials.client_id,
        'client_secret': credentials.client_secret,
        'scopes': credentials.scopes,
        'id_token': credentials.id_token,
    }


def authorize(callback_uri, client_config, scopes):
    """
    Builds the URL that will be used for redirection to Google
    to start the OAuth flow.
    """

    # specify the flow configuration details
    flow = google_auth_oauthlib.flow.Flow.from_client_config(
        client_config=client_config,
        scopes=scopes,
    )
    flow.redirect_uri = callback_uri

    # create a random state
    state = str(uuid4())

    # get the authorization URL
    authorization_url, state = flow.authorization_url(
        # offline access allows access token refresh without reprompting the user
        # using online here to force log in
        access_type='online',
        state=state,
        prompt='consent',
        include_granted_scopes='false',
    )

    return authorization_url, state

def handle_callback(callback_uri, client_config, scopes, request_url, stored_state, received_state):
    """
    Fetches credentials using the authorization code in the request URL,
    and retrieves user information for the logged-in user.
    """

    # validate received state
    if received_state != stored_state:
        raise Unauthorized(f'Invalid state parameter: received={received_state} stored={stored_state}')

    # specify the flow configuration details
    flow = google_auth_oauthlib.flow.Flow.from_client_config(
        client_config=client_config,
        scopes=scopes
    )
    flow.redirect_uri = callback_uri

    # get a token using the details in the request
    flow.fetch_token(authorization_response=request_url)
    credentials = flow.credentials

    oauth2_client = build('oauth2','v2',credentials=credentials, cache_discovery=False)
    user_info = oauth2_client.userinfo().get().execute()

    return _credentials_to_dict(credentials), user_info

EOF
Copied!
The authorize() function starts the authorization sequence. It configures the flow by using the passed in client_config parameter, which will be built from the OAuth configuration JSON string stored as a secret. The callback_uri specifies where Google will call with the authorization code. This URI must match a URI configured as an authorized redirect URI for the Bookshelf application. The flow.authorization_url() call builds the full URL for the redirection to Google. A state is created and passed in, and it will be stored in the session to match this call with the eventual callback. The authorization URL and state are returned to the caller.

The handle_callback() function is used when the callback is received from Google. The state specified in the callback URL must match the stored state that was sent in the authorization URL. The flow.fetch_token() call can then be used to fetch the credentials, including the refresh and access tokens. The returned credentials are then used to call Google and receive user info for the logged-in user. The credentials and user info are then returned to the caller.

Note: The oauth2_client.userinfo() line might show an error message in your IDE indicating that there is no userinfo member. A Resource object is returned by build(), and the valid members are not known at compile time. This error can be ignored.
Task 5. Add login, callback, and logout endpoints
In this task, you use the OAuth functions you just created to implement login, logout, and callback endpoints.

Modify the HTML templates
To create an error template, run the following command:

cat > ~/bookshelf/templates/error.html <<EOF
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}

<h3>Error: {{error_message}}</h3>

{% endblock %}

EOF
Copied!
When logging in, the user might encounter an error. This page will be used to display the error.

In a file editor, open the file ~/bookshelf/templates/base.html.

Login and logout links will be added to the application.

In the navbar section, on the line after the closing tag (/ul) of the unordered list (ul) with class="nav navbar-nav", add the following section:

                <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
                    {% if session['credentials'] %}
                    <div class="navbar-brand">{{session['user'].email}}</div>
                    <div class="navbar-brand"><a href="/logout">Logout</a></div>
                    {% else %}
                    <div class="navbar-brand"><a href="/login">Login</a></div>
                    {% endif %}
                </ul>
Copied!
The file will now look like this:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Bookshelf</title>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="navbar navbar-default">
            <div class="container">
                <div class="navbar-header">
                    <div class="navbar-brand">Bookshelf</div>
                </div>
                <ul class="navbar-nav">
                    <li><a href="/">Books</a></li>
                </ul>
                <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
                    {% if session['credentials'] %}
                    <div class="navbar-brand">{{session['user'].email}}</div>
                    <div class="navbar-brand"><a href="/logout">Logout</a></div>
                    {% else %}
                    <div class="navbar-brand"><a href="/login">Login</a></div>
                    {% endif %}
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            {% block content %}{% endblock %}
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
The base template now uses the session to check if the user is logged in. If the user is logged in, the user's email address and a logout link are shown. If the user is not logged in, a login link is shown.

Save the file.

Modify imports
In a file editor, open the file ~/bookshelf/main.py.

Add session to the flask imports.

The flask imports should now look like this:

from flask import current_app, Flask, redirect, render_template
from flask import request, url_for, session
A session will provide access to information that is associated with the logged-in user. The session data will be stored in cookies.

After the cloud_logging import line, add the following lines:

import json
import os
from urllib.parse import urlparse
Copied!
In main.py, the json library is used to convert the client secret string to a mapping (object), and the os library is used to use environment variables. The urlparse() function will be used to replace the scheme and hostname in a URL.

After the import for secrets, add the following line:

import oauth
Copied!
This imports the OAuth functions you created.

Add configuration items
In the app.config.update() function call, add the following lines after the ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS line:

    CLIENT_SECRETS=json.loads(secrets.get_secret('bookshelf-client-secrets')),
    SCOPES=[
        'openid',
        'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts.readonly',
        'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email',
        'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile',
    ],
    EXTERNAL_HOST_URL=os.getenv('EXTERNAL_HOST_URL'),
Copied!
The following configuration items are added:

CLIENT_SECRETS contains a mapping (object) for the OAuth configuration that was stored in Secret Manager.
SCOPES contains a list of scopes to be requested.
EXTERNAL_HOST_URL is used to determine the callback URL. When you use Web Preview with Cloud Shell, the application set to run as localhost (127.0.0.1) port 80 is exposed to the internet on https://8080-...-cloudshell.dev. This URL will be used to convert the localhost URL for the callback endpoint to the publicly accessible URL. The value will be passed in as an environment variable.
Add endpoints and supporting functions
After the log_request() function (which starts with def log_request():), add the following functions:


def logout_session():
    """
    Clears known session items.
    """
    session.pop('credentials', None)
    session.pop('user', None)
    session.pop('state', None)
    session.pop('error_message', None)
    session.pop('login_return', None)
    return


def external_url(url):
    """
    Cloud Shell routes https://8080-***/ to localhost over http
    This function replaces the localhost host with the configured scheme + hostname
    """
    external_host_url = current_app.config['EXTERNAL_HOST_URL']
    if external_host_url is None:
        # force https
        if url.startswith('http://'):

Copied!
The logout_session() function clears known session entries.

The external_url() function replaces the scheme and hostname of a URL with a different hostname for external access. If the replacement hostname is not specified, the function will ensure that the returned URL is using https.

The /error endpoint is used to display an error.

The /login endpoint checks the session to see if a user is logged in. A user is logged in if credentials are stored in the session. If the user is not logged in, oauth.authorize() is called to get the authorization URL and state for the redirection to Google. The state is saved in the session, and then the browser is redirected to the authorization URL.

The /oauth2callback endpoint is called by Google during the authorization process. If there was an error, then the process was unsuccessful, and the user is redirected to the error page. If not an error, handle_callback() is called to retrieve the token and user information. At the end of the process, the user is redirected to the previous page where the login was automatically started, or to the root page (book list) if there is no return location.

The /logout endpoint logs out the user by removing credentials and user data from the session, and returns to the root page.

Force log in when adding, editing, or deleting books
A user can browse the books on the bookshelf without being logged in. However, it makes sense to force a user to log in before they can modify the books in any way.

When a user tries to add, edit, or delete a book, but they are not logged in, they should be forced to login.

In the add() function, directly after the call to log_request(), add the following lines:


    # must be logged in
    if "credentials" not in session:
        session['login_return'] = url_for('.add')
        return redirect(url_for('.login'))
Copied!
In add(), if the user is not logged in, they are returned to the add page after login.

In the edit() function, directly after the call to log_request(), add the following lines:


    # must be logged in
    if "credentials" not in session:
        session['login_return'] = url_for('.edit', book_id=book_id)
        return redirect(url_for('.login'))
Copied!
In edit(), if the user is not logged in, they are returned to the edit page for this book after login.

In the delete() function, directly after the call to log_request(), add the following lines:


    # must be logged in
    if "credentials" not in session:
        session['login_return'] = url_for('.view', book_id=book_id)
        return redirect(url_for('.login'))
Copied!
In delete(), if the user is not logged in, they are returned to the view page for this book after login.

Save the file.

Test the application
To start the HTTP server, in Cloud Shell, run the following command:

cd ~/bookshelf; EXTERNAL_HOST_URL="https://8080-$WEB_HOST" ~/.local/bin/gunicorn -b :8080 main:app
Copied!
There is an environment variable being passed in to the application:

EXTERNAL_HOST_URL specifies the scheme and hostname that should be used in the callback URL. If this environment variable is not specified, the redirect_uri passed to Google in the authorization URL will use the hostname that the application sees in incoming URLs: 127.0.0.1:8080, which is localhost. Web Preview forwards requests from the cloudshell.dev URL to localhost (http://127.0.0.1:8080).
Note: If asked to authorize Cloud Shell, click Authorize.
To open the application in the web browser, click Web Preview, and then select Preview on port 8080.

Web Preview on port 8080

A new tab is opened in the browser, and the application is running. You should see the Wizard of Oz book. The user is not logged in.

Click + Add book.

You must be logged in to add a book, so you're asked to choose an account for signing in with Google:

Choose an account

Click the student email, and then click Continue.

Google will now obtain consent for any restricted or non-sensitive scopes that are being requested. In this case, downloading all of your contacts is a sensitive scope.

Obtain consent

Click Allow.

You're returned to the application on the Add book page. You're logged in, with your email in the upper right corner. If you look at the logs in Cloud Shell, you should see the callback call from Google:

INFO:main:REQ: GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/oauth2callback?state=88789b07-2474-423f-b572-f5d4a3240ace&code=4g0AfJohXm0vtB2eYHnRaAeM8m-VCmnssg5YgrjoJstTLmHaVq8nlbJo5uzIS67NbWTXTOqDw&scope=email%20profile%20openid%20https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts.readonly%20https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email%20https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile&authuser=0&hd=qwiklabs.net&prompt=consent
The user consented to access, so the parameter named code has the authorization code that was subsequently exchanged for the credentials. The scopes allowed are also returned.

Click Books, and then click + Add Book.

You're already logged in, so you can go directly to the Add book page.

Click Logout, and then click Login.

Click the student email, then click Continue, and then click Cancel.

You're returned to the error page. Look at the logs in Cloud Shell. You should see the callback made by Google, which should look something like this:

INFO:main:REQ: GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/oauth2callback?error=access_denied&state=72342071-c8dc-43be-8184-9f6bd6069cd5
In this case, the consent was not provided, so the authorization code was not returned and the application cannot get credentials for the user.

In Cloud Shell, to quit the application, enter CTRL-C.

To verify the objective, click Check my progress.
Add login, callback, and logout endpoints

Task 6. Create functions for translation
In this task, you create functions that use the Cloud Translation API to detect text language and translate text.

Calls to the Cloud Translation API use the credentials of the application.

Add Cloud Translation dependency
The application requires another Python package.

In the ~/bookshelf/requirements.txt file, add the following line:

google-cloud-translate==3.21.1
Copied!
The requirements.txt file should now look like this:

Flask==3.1.1
gunicorn==23.0.0
google-cloud-logging==3.12.1
google-cloud-firestore==2.21.0
google-cloud-storage==2.17.0
google-cloud-secret-manager==2.24.0
google-api-python-client==2.178.0
google-auth==2.40.3
google-auth-oauthlib==1.2.2
google-cloud-translate==3.21.1
Save the file.

To install the updated dependencies, run the following command:

pip3 install -r ~/bookshelf/requirements.txt --user
Copied!
Add translation functions
The translate.py file contains code to perform translation.

To create the translate.py file, run the following command:

cat > ~/bookshelf/translate.py <<EOF
import os
from google.cloud import translate

PROJECT_ID = os.getenv('GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT')
PARENT = f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}"

supported_languages = None

def get_languages():
    """
    Gets the list of supported languages.
    """

    # use the global variable
    global supported_languages

    # retrieve supported languages if not previously retrieved
    if not supported_languages:
        client = translate.TranslationServiceClient()

        response = client.get_supported_languages(
            parent=PARENT,
            display_language_code='en',
        )

        supported_languages = response.languages

    return supported_languages


def detect_language(text):
    """
    Detect the language of the supplied text.
    Returns the most likely language.
    """

    client = translate.TranslationServiceClient()

    response = client.detect_language(
        parent=PARENT,
        content=text,
    )

    return response.languages[0]


def translate_text(text, target_language_code):
    """
    Translate the text to the target language.
    """

    client = translate.TranslationServiceClient()

    response = client.translate_text(
        parent=PARENT,
        contents=[text],
        target_language_code=target_language_code,
    )

    return response.translations[0]

EOF
Copied!
The get_languages() function retrieves the list of languages supported by the Cloud Translation API. Each language in the list contains an ID (language_code) and the display text (display_name).

The detect_language() function detects the language for a text string.

The translate_language() function translates text into a specified language.

Task 7. Create a user profile for language selection and translate descriptions
In this task, you create a user profile for logged-in users. A preferred language can be selected for the user.

The profile will be stored in a Firestore collection named profiles. A default profile with a preferred language of English will be used until the user updates the profile.

Add functions to read and update profiles
The profiledb.py file contains code to read and update user profiles. The email address of the user will be used as the profile key. In this implementation, the only item in the profile will be the preferred language.

To create the profiledb.py file, run the following command:

cat > ~/bookshelf/profiledb.py <<EOF
from google.cloud import firestore


default_profile = { "preferredLanguage": "en" }


def __document_to_dict(doc):
    if not doc.exists:
        return None
    doc_dict = doc.to_dict()
    doc_dict['id'] = doc.id
    return doc_dict


def read(email):
    """
    Return a profile by email.
    """

    db = firestore.Client()

    # retrieve a profile from the database by ID
    profile_ref = db.collection("profiles").document(email)

    profile_dict = __document_to_dict(profile_ref.get())

    # return empty dictionary if no profile
    if profile_dict is None:
        profile_dict = default_profile.copy()

    return profile_dict


def read_entry(email, key, default_value=''):
    """
    Return a profile entry by email and key.
    """

    profile_dict = read(email)
    return profile_dict.get(key, default_value)


def update(data, email):
    """
    Update a profile, and return the updated profile's details.
    """

    db = firestore.Client()

    # update profile in database
    profile_ref = db.collection("profiles").document(email)
    profile_ref.set(data)

    return __document_to_dict(profile_ref.get())

EOF
Copied!
The read() function retrieves a profile for a specified user. If a profile is not found, a copy of the default profile is returned.

The read_entry() function returns a single value from a user's profile. If the key is not found in the user's profile, the passed in default value is returned instead.

The update() function creates or overwrites the user's profile with the specified data.

Add the profile endpoint to view and edit a user profile
To create a new template for the user profile in profile.html, run the following command:

cat > ~/bookshelf/templates/profile.html <<EOF
{# [START form] #}
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}

<h3>Profile for {{session['user']['email']}}</h3>

<form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">

    <div class="form-group">
        <label for="preferredLanguage">Preferred Language</label>
        <select id="preferredLanguage" name="preferredLanguage">
            {% for l in languages %}
            {% if l.language_code == profile['preferredLanguage'] %}
            <option value="{{l.language_code}}" selected>{{l.display_name}}</option>
            {% else %}
            <option value="{{l.language_code}}">{{l.display_name}}</option>
            {% endif %}
            {% endfor %}
        </select>
    </div>

    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-success">Save</button>
</form>

{% endblock %}

{# [END form] #}

EOF
Copied!
This template creates a single form with a select control and a submit button. The select control is loaded with all of the languages passed in using the languages list variable. The value of each entry is the language_code, and the display_name is shown in the select control. The initially displayed language is the preferredLanguage specified in the profile.

In a file editor, open the file ~/bookshelf/main.py.

After the import for oauth, add the following lines:

import translate
import profiledb
Copied!
This imports the translate.py and profiledb.py files you just created.

To add the /profile endpoint, add the following function after the /books/<book_id>/delete endpoint:


@app.route('/profile', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def profile():
    """
    If GET, show the form to collect updated details for the user profile.
    If POST, update the profile based on the specified form.
    """
    log_request(request)

    # must be logged in
    if "credentials" not in session:
        session['login_return'] = url_for('.profile')
        return redirect(url_for('.login'))

    # read existing profile
    email = session['user']['email']
    profile = profiledb.read(email)

    # Save details if form was posted
    if request.method == 'POST':

        # get book details from form
        data = request.form.to_dict(flat=True)

        # update profile
        profiledb.update(data, email)
        session['preferred_language'] = data['preferredLanguage']

        # return to root
        return redirect(url_for('.list'))

    # render form to update book
    return render_template('profile.html', action='Edit',
        profile=profile, languages=translate.get_languages())
Copied!
The profile can only be accessed for logged-in users, so the user is redirected to login if not already logged in.

The email of the logged-in user is taken from the user information in the session, and then the current profile is read.

The profile is rendered by using the profile.html template.

After you click the submit button, the profile is updated in the database, the preferred language for the user is stored in the session, and the browser is redirected to the root page.

Save the file.

Navigate to the profile when clicking on the user's email address
In a file editor, open the file ~/bookshelf/templates/base.html.

In this file, change the following line from:

<div class="navbar-brand">{{session['user'].email}}</div>
to:

<div class="navbar-brand"><a href="/profile">{{session['user'].email}}</a></div>
Copied!
This changes the displayed email address to a clickable link that redirects to the /profile endpoint.

Save the file.

Translate the description on the view page
In a file editor, open the file ~/bookshelf/templates/view.html.

In this file, change the following line from:

<p class="book-description">{{book.description}}</p>
to:

        {% if translation_language is not none %}
        <p class="book-description"><strong>Description ({{description_language}}): </strong>{{book.description}}</p>
        <p class="book-description"><strong>Translation ({{translation_language}}): </strong>{{translated_text}}</p>
        {% else %}
        <p class="book-description"><strong>Description: </strong>{{book.description}}</p>
        {% endif %}
Copied!
If translation_language is not specified, the description is unchanged. However, if there is a translation language, then the language of the original description is displayed, and the next line shows the translated version with the text. The view endpoint must pass in this extra information.

Save the file.

In a file editor, open the file ~/bookshelf/main.py.

After the log_request() function (which starts with def log_request():), add the following code:


# build a mapping of language codes to display names

display_languages = {}
for l in translate.get_languages():
    display_languages[l.language_code] = l.display_name
Copied!
The detect_language() function returns a detected language code, but no display name. This code creates a mapping from language code to display name. This will be used for displaying the detected language on the view template.

Replace the entire view endpoint code with the following:

@app.route('/books/<book_id>')
def view(book_id):
    """
    View the details of a specified book.
    """
    log_request(request)

    # retrieve a specific book
    book = booksdb.read(book_id)
    current_app.logger.info(f"book={book}")

    # defaults if logged out
    description_language = None
    translation_language = None
    translated_text = ''
    if book['description'] and "credentials" in session:
        preferred_language = session.get('preferred_language', 'en')

        # translate description
        translation = translate.translate_text(
            text=book['description'],
            target_language_code=preferred_language,
        )
        description_language = display_languages[translation.detected_language_code]
        translation_language = display_languages[preferred_language]
        translated_text = translation.translated_text

    # render book details
    return render_template('view.html', book=book,
        translated_text=translated_text,
        description_language=description_language,
        translation_language=translation_language,
    )
Copied!
The code now translates the book's description into the user's preferred language and passes the translation and languages to the template.

Save the file.

Task 8. Test the application
To start the HTTP server, run the following command:

cd ~/bookshelf; EXTERNAL_HOST_URL="https://8080-$WEB_HOST" ~/.local/bin/gunicorn -b :8080 main:app
Copied!
